üó£Ô∏è Review by a Hiring Manager / HR Person
Seeing this document from a candidate would certainly be memorable, and my reaction would depend heavily on the role, the candidate's perceived value, and our company culture.

Initial Impression:

Unconventional & Bold: This is not standard practice. It signals a candidate who is highly organized, knows what they want, and is not afraid to be assertive. This could be positive (proactive, clear communicator) or negative (potentially inflexible, demanding, high-maintenance, or not understanding typical employment norms).
Potential Red Flags:
The immediate presentation of extensive "terms" can feel adversarial, as if the candidate anticipates problems or is trying to dictate the relationship from the outset.
Clauses like the specific mental health protocol or demanding an NDA for their LLC might make HR wary of potential complexities, legal entanglements, or an unwillingness to integrate into standard company processes.
It might suggest the candidate prioritizes their own business significantly over the prospective employment.
Clause-by-Clause Reaction:

Clause 1 (Dual Employment): This is a common enough situation for highly skilled individuals. The request for a written exception if it conflicts with policy is reasonable to ask, though it requires internal approvals. The key concern would be ensuring no conflict of interest or impact on performance for our company. If the candidate is upfront, it's better than finding out later.
Clause 2 (Mutual NDA for LLC): This would raise eyebrows. We'd question why our company needs to take on the obligation of an NDA for an employee's other company. Our primary concern is protecting our IP. We'd likely prefer the candidate to simply not disclose their LLC's trade secrets if they aren't directly relevant to the tasks we are hiring them for. This feels like it could create unnecessary legal overhead for us.
Clause 3 (Mental Health): This clause would be a significant concern for HR. While we are committed to supporting employees and complying with ADA/FMLA, we have established policies and procedures for handling medical leave and accommodations. A candidate trying to dictate a custom protocol with specific timelines outside of these established, legally vetted processes is problematic. It suggests a potential misunderstanding of how these matters are typically and legally handled. We'd direct this to our standard accommodation process.
Clause 4 (Employment Classification): This is fine. Offering flexibility can be good, and we can discuss the best fit and corresponding compensation.
Clause 5 (Location/Travel): Clear preferences. Standard negotiation points. If we can meet them, great. If not, it's a point of discussion.
Clause 6 (Additional Terms):
Role definition, respectful environment, feedback: These are all positive and align with good management practices. We'd likely see these as reasonable expectations.
Professional development: We support this, so it's a good point of alignment.
IP: This is standard to discuss and would be covered in our employment agreement. Clarifying pre-existing IP is good.
Clause 7 (Amendment & Precedence): This signals an intent to have these terms take precedence or be heavily considered, which reinforces the perception of the candidate being quite firm on their conditions.
Overall HR/Hiring Manager Perspective:

For a Superstar Candidate: If this candidate has exceptionally rare and valuable skills, and we desperately need them, we might be willing to go through the significant effort of reviewing, negotiating, and potentially creating exceptions for some of these terms.
For a Typical Candidate: This document could be a barrier. It creates a lot of upfront work for legal and HR before an offer can even be extended. It might make the candidate seem less adaptable or more focused on their own agenda than the company's needs. We might opt for a candidate who is a simpler "yes."
Impact on Negotiation: It sets a very clear (and somewhat demanding) starting point from the candidate. This isn't necessarily bad, but it means we know we're in for a detailed negotiation if we proceed.
Cultural Fit: In a very flexible, candidate-driven startup culture, this might be seen as innovative. In a more traditional or larger corporate environment, it would likely be seen as unusual and potentially problematic.
Recommendation to the Candidate (from HR/Hiring Manager perspective):

Instead of a formal "Terms and Conditions" document, consider raising your most critical points (e.g., need to continue your LLC, location preferences, general compensation expectations based on employment type) during later-stage interviews or when an offer is imminent.
For sensitive topics like mental health accommodations or specific IP concerns related to your LLC, discuss them directly and collaboratively rather than presenting them as non-negotiable terms.
This document, as written, could be better used as your internal checklist of things you want to negotiate or clarify, rather than something you hand over at the start of an engagement discussion.
