üìÑ Terms and Conditions for Professional Engagement
Preamble: This document outlines the foundational terms and conditions under which I, [Your Name] (hereinafter "the Individual"), am prepared to offer my professional services to and engage with Prospective Entity (hereinafter "the Company"). These terms are presented to establish mutual understanding and form a basis for any subsequent contractual agreement, be it for employment or independent contracting services.

Clauses:

1. üíº Dual Professional Engagement & Existing Business Entity
* The Individual is the Owner and CEO of Thought Parameters LLC, a duly registered and operating business entity.
* Should the Company engage the Individual as a W2 employee, it is expressly understood and agreed that such employment shall not require the Individual to close, pause, or otherwise limit the good-faith operations of Thought Parameters LLC, provided such operations do not create a direct, material conflict of interest with the specific duties assigned by the Company during the Company's established working hours, or otherwise violate separately agreed-upon confidentiality obligations to the Company.
* The Individual agrees to manage Thought Parameters LLC activities outside of the working hours agreed upon with the Company, unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing.
* If any standard Company policy, employee handbook provision, or other employment-related documentation (collectively "Company Policies") would otherwise restrict or prohibit such concurrent engagement, an explicit written exception to such Company Policies must be documented and executed by an officer or designated representative of the Company possessing the unequivocal authority to grant such an exception. This written exception shall be considered an addendum to any employment agreement.

2. üõ°Ô∏è Mutual Confidentiality & Non-Disclosure for Thought Parameters LLC
* Given the Individual's role as Owner and CEO of Thought Parameters LLC, discussions during the engagement with the Company, or even during the interview process, may necessitate reference to or disclosure of concepts, methodologies, or information ("LLC Proprietary Information") that are proprietary to Thought Parameters LLC. LLC Proprietary Information may include, but is not limited to, trade secrets, business strategies, client information, operational processes, or intellectual property developed by or for Thought Parameters LLC.
* Such LLC Proprietary Information may be relevant to demonstrating the Individual's skills, knowledge, strategic thinking, or problem-solving capabilities, some of which may extend beyond the direct scope of duties anticipated to be assigned by the Company.
* Therefore, should the Company engage the Individual, the Company may be required to enter into a separate, mutually acceptable Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) with Thought Parameters LLC to protect such LLC Proprietary Information. This NDA shall be negotiated in good faith by both parties. The Individual shall make best efforts to avoid disclosure of LLC Proprietary Information unless reasonably necessary and covered by such an NDA.

3. üß† Mental Health & Notification Protocol
* The Individual is committed to performing their duties diligently and professionally. However, the Individual recognizes the importance of mental health.
* Should a significant mental health issue arise that acutely impacts the Individual's ability to perform their duties or to maintain immediate communication, the Individual shall endeavor to notify their direct supervisor or Human Resources department at the Company (as appropriate) within one (1) calendar week of the onset of such acute impact, provided the Individual is reasonably capable of doing so.
* Upon receipt of such notification, the Company may proceed with actions it deems in its best business interest concerning coverage of the Individual's responsibilities.
* However, following said notification, the Company agrees to provide the Individual a period of two (2) additional calendar weeks (totaling approximately three (3) weeks from the initial one-week notification window, if notification is prompt) for the Individual to address the mental health issue and to rectify any deficiencies or backlogs in their work performance that arose due to said mental health issue.
* Suspension or termination of employment or engagement on the grounds of performance issues directly and solely attributable to the notified mental health event shall be deferred until the expiry of this three-week aggregate period, allowing the Individual a reasonable opportunity to demonstrate recovery and remediation efforts. This clause is subject to any superseding applicable laws (e.g., ADA, FMLA).

4. üí∞ Employment Classification & Compensation Structure
* The Individual is open to engagement under various classifications, including:
* a) 1099 Independent Contractor (Individual)
* b) Corp-to-Corp (via Thought Parameters LLC)
* c) W2 Employee
* It is understood and agreed that the base pay, rate, or salary (collectively "Compensation") will differ based on the chosen classification. This differentiation will reflect the varying overhead, tax burdens, benefits (or lack thereof), insurance costs, and administrative expenses associated with each classification for the Individual and/or Thought Parameters LLC.
* Specific Compensation for each classification will be negotiated and agreed upon in writing prior to the commencement of services.

5. üìç Location of Work & Travel
* The Individual's services shall be rendered under one of the following location arrangements, to be mutually agreed upon in writing:
* a) Based in Orange County, California, for full-time on-site or hybrid roles.
* b) 100% Remote.
* The Company agrees to minimize any travel requirements for the Individual to the absolute essential minimum required to achieve bona fide business objectives that cannot be reasonably accomplished through remote means. All pre-approved travel expenses shall be reimbursed by the Company in accordance.

6. ü§ù Additional Terms & Understandings
* Clear Role Definition: The Company shall provide a clear and comprehensive definition of the Individual‚Äôs role, responsibilities, reporting structure, and performance expectations upon engagement.
* Professional Development: The Company is encouraged to support reasonable opportunities for professional development relevant to the Individual's role, where mutually beneficial.
* Intellectual Property (Pre-existing): The Individual retains all rights to their pre-existing intellectual property and any intellectual property developed by Thought Parameters LLC independently of work performed for the Company. Any intellectual property developed by the Individual specifically for the Company during the engagement as a W2 employee and directly related to assigned duties shall be subject to the terms of the Company's standard IP agreement, to be reviewed and agreed upon. For 1099/Corp-to-Corp engagements, IP ownership will be explicitly defined in the service agreement.
* Respectful Work Environment: The Individual expects and will contribute to a professional and respectful work environment, free from harassment and discrimination.
* Regular Feedback: The Individual values and requests opportunities for regular, constructive performance feedback.

7. üìú Amendment & Precedence
* These Terms and Conditions for Professional Engagement may only be amended by a written agreement signed by both the Individual and an authorized representative of the Company.
* In the event of a conflict between these terms and any standard Company employment agreement, offer letter, or policy, the terms most favorable to the Individual's ability to operate Thought Parameters LLC and the specific provisions outlined herein (particularly regarding Dual Professional Engagement, NDA for Thought Parameters LLC, and Mental Health Protocol) shall be subject to good faith negotiation to reach a mutually acceptable resolution, which must be documented in writing as per Clause 1.
